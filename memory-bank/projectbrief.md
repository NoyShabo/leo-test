## Project Brief

Build a React (Vite) news site shell that visually mimics the Time Out article page layout in RTL. Implement a single article page with header, nav, hero image, body typography, and footer blocks.

Non-goals: copying proprietary CSS or content. We will implement bespoke CSS that reproduces look and flow.

Deliverables:
- React app scaffold
- Article page route and layout
- Header and footer
- RTL typography and spacing
- Memory Bank documentation
